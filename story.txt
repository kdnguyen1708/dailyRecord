One day, Adam goes outside to hunt. In order to get to the place for hunting he has to walk really far from his house.
The surround scenery as he walking is beautiful: birds are singing, flowers are booming and the sun is shining over his 
path. Unfortunately, he does not have breakfast that morning so he gets tired really quickly so he stops at a nearby river.
