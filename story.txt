One day, Adam goes outside to hunt. In order to get to the place for hunting he has to walk really far from his house.
The surrounding scenery as he walking is beautiful: birds are singing, flowers are blooming and the sun is shining over his 
path. Unfortunately, he does not have breakfast that morning so he gets tired really quickly so he stops at a nearby river.

Luckily, while he is resting, he spots a deer approach the river in order to drink. His stomach rumbles in anticipation. 
As carefully as he can he prepars his bow and arrow. The deer seems too distracted to notice. Taking aim, he looses an arrow,
and strikes true, piercing the neck for a quick and painless fight. He wouldn't be going hungry today! Now, however, he has to manage to bring it home.
